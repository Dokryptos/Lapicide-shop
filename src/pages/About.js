             Introducing "Lapicide," 
             a serif typeface that draws inspiration from the art of stone engraving and the skillful craftsmanship of stonecutters.
             The name "Lapicide" encompasses both the stone engraving technique and the resulting masterpiece it produces. 
             The typeface captures the essence of inscriptions meticulously carved into architectural elements and monuments, 
             known specifically as "lapidary inscriptions." With distinct serifs and unique, chiseled-looking terminals, 
             Lapicide replicates the effect of engraved typography on stone surfaces. The typeface evokes a sense of timelessness and reverence, 
             harkening back to the rich history of stone carving and the enduring legacy of inscriptions left for generations to come. 
             Lapicide is a tribute to the ancient art of engraving and a versatile font choice that brings an air of refined elegance, 
             be it in print or digital media.
